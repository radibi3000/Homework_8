                <p class="summaryText"> As a technology and cognitive psychology enthusiast, I have always been
                    interested in understanding users' ideas and visions to improve online platforms and
                    products. I
                    have worked in several organizations, including start-up companies and non-profit
                    organizations,
                    where I always strive to engage thoughtfully in every aspect of the UX research process.

                    I am drawn to user research because it connects my passions at the intersection of
                    psychology
                    and
                    technology. Through the Design Thinking process, I aspire to create socially responsible and
                    equitable products that enhance social justice initiatives and improve user accessibility.
                    Through
                    UX research, I aspire to understand and bolster people's unique histories, social contexts,
                    and
                    opinions.

                    Outside of UX research, I enjoy studying philosophy, hiking, listening to music, and
                    watching
                    movies. I am a first-generation Iranian American and my culture and heritage are a huge part
                    of
                    my
                    identity and interests. Please feel free to reach out; I look forward to connecting! </p>
