                            <h3> Through ongoing ethnographic interviews and media analysis, this project
                                has identified a
                                unique set of roles and responsibilities brought on by the rapid automation of waste
                                management workplaces
                                during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of the Fall semester I worked with the
                                Tech Solidarity Lab at CMU in an effort to,
                                engage a
                                broad
                                set of
                                stakeholders in waste management to design new roll out strategies, best practices, and
                                training materials for the
                                deployment of AI technologies in essential sectors.</h3>

                                stakeholders. I learned a lot about how to carry myself in a meeting and how to conduct
