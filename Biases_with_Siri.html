                            <h3> Voices recognition softwares are a integral part of our lives, especially in the modern
                                age
                                however these technologies are not exempt from shortcomings. In an academic course at
                                Carneige Mellon a team and I conducted user research on this issue. <br><br>
                                Our generative background
                                research
                                suggested that many voice recognition technogies today do not work well with
                                non-American accents, predominantly uses female voices as default for assistance, and
                                have prevalent data privacy concerns; many of these issues at hand are embedded in the
                                algorithm. Thus, the question we ask is: How might we harness everyday usersâ€™ power to
                                alleviate AI biases in voice recognition technologies? To better understand this we
                                conducted various research activities to investigate further.</h3>
